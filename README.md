# oceanFluxDynamics

This repository contains research I have done with the [Freilich Lab](https://mara-freilich.github.io/) at Brown University, led by Professor Mara Freilich. My research was also advised by Dr. Lily Dove at Brown. 

## Spring 2024

My first involvement in this research was during the spring of my junior year. I was selected for this position by Brown's UTRA (Undergraduate Teaching and Research Awards) program. 

Over this semester, I investigated data from one specific underwater autonomous glider, that had just finished collecting data in a remote area of the Southern Ocean (roughly between Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica) that winter. I used Python to extract the data and visualize it, through time series plots of various features and videos that also incorporated satellite data.

I created two slides related to this:
1. [Elevator Pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m4aBKmNJGs21ljofyKiFWU_6Lt0BKg-Ta9PTBaX6MBA/edit?usp=sharing) - presented at UTRA research presentation session.
2. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17Xp1cHxg9wq9wrmeshBfp76Z0Yh6GYWx8WbGK1--UD0/edit?usp=sharing) - a compilation of all images & video from the code, with some annotations and next steps.

## Fall 2024 - Spring 2025

During my senior year, I will be writing my honors thesis for my Applied Mathematics - Computer Science concentration on mathematical modeling research regarding these ocean flux dynamics, building on my data exploration from my junior year. Details TBD.
